As we move into 2025, cybersecurity threats are evolving at an unprecedented pace, with technologies like AI and quantum computing reshaping the landscape. This guide will explore top cybersecurity trends for 2025, offering actionable insights to keep your organization secure.\nWhy 2025 Will Be a Turning Point in Cybersecurity # With advancements in AI, quantum computing, and IoT, 2025 represents a critical time for organizations to strengthen their cybersecurity defenses. According to The SHI Resource Hub, a majority of businesses are investing in emerging cybersecurity measures to stay ahead.\n1. AI-Driven Threats: The Double-Edged Sword # AI is both a powerful defense tool and a significant threat. Cybercriminals are using AI to enhance attacks, automating phishing and creating deepfake identities.\nFor example, in 2024, a financial firm fell victim to an AI-generated voice scam where attackers cloned the CEO\u0026rsquo;s voice to authorize a fraudulent transfer of $10 million.\nOrganizations must adopt AI-powered defense systems to counter these sophisticated threats.\nKey Stats: # AI in Cybersecurity Market: Expected to reach $49 billion by 2027 (USCSI Institute). AI-Driven Attacks: Projected to account for 17% of data breaches by 2027 (ITPro). Actionable Tips:\nInvest in AI-driven threat detection tools for automation in response. Use predictive analytics to anticipate cyber threats. 2. Quantum Computing: Redefining Cryptography Standards # Quantum computing poses a risk to traditional encryption. NIST advises that quantum-resistant cryptography is necessary by 2025.\nConsider that quantum computers could potentially break RSA-2048 encryption in a matter of hours, exposing sensitive data like financial records and personal information to cybercriminals.\nKey Stats: # Data Vulnerability: Nearly 50% of current encryption could be compromised (Centre for Cybersecurity). Actionable Tips:\nBegin implementing quantum-resistant encryption now. Conduct encryption audits regularly. 3. IoT \u0026amp; 5G: Security Challenges Multiply # With the growth of 5G and IoT, risks expand. Weak IoT security, coupled with 5G’s connectivity, creates vulnerabilities.\nFor instance, in a recent case, hackers exploited a vulnerability in a smart thermostat to gain access to a corporate network, leading to a data breach that affected thousands of customers.\nKey Stats: # IoT Proliferation: Expected to reach 30 billion devices by 2025 (ITPro). Actionable Tips:\nSecure IoT devices with regular firmware updates. Use 5G network slicing for secure data isolation. 4. Zero-Trust Architecture: Strengthening Security from Within # Zero-trust is essential for today’s hybrid work environments. A zero-trust approach minimizes risks by assuming all networks are untrusted.\nA global tech company implemented zero-trust architecture and reduced unauthorized access incidents by 60%, significantly improving their overall security posture.\nKey Stats: # Zero-Trust Adoption: 61% of companies are now utilizing zero-trust (BeyondTrust). Actionable Tips:\nApply multi-factor authentication and continuous monitoring. Use micro-segmentation to limit access. 5. Supply Chain Security: Third-Party Vulnerabilities # Supply chains are a prime target for cyber threats. Implementing a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) helps in mitigating risks.\nIn 2023, a major retailer suffered a breach due to a compromised third-party vendor, resulting in the loss of customer credit card information and damaging the company\u0026rsquo;s reputation.\nKey Stats: # Third-Party Breaches: 45% of organizations faced security incidents through third-party vendors (ITPro). Actionable Tips:\nConduct risk assessments on all vendors. Maintain SBOM analysis for transparency. Key Takeaways for 2025 # Adopt AI defenses to mitigate AI-driven attacks. Transition to quantum-resistant encryption to safeguard data. Strengthen IoT and 5G security with proactive measures. Implement zero-trust to protect your network. Secure supply chains through SBOM and third-party audits.

At that time, I was 20 years old and in my second year of a Computer Science program. I had never been particularly fond of learning or attending university classes, and I lacked the confidence to apply for jobs. However, it quickly became clear that sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s important not to undervalue yourself but to be at least realistic about your knowledge.\nThe Push I Needed # It likely would have taken me a long time to muster the courage to submit my first CV, as I always felt I didn\u0026rsquo;t have enough knowledge—especially since I wasn\u0026rsquo;t attending classes. Yet, I had been interacting with servers and databases since I was around 11-12 years old, back in 2008-2009. This background is part of the IT journey that continues to fuel my curiosity even now, at 27, which I will delve into in a future blog post.\nI want to take a moment to thank @Dacian for giving me that much-needed push to get going. Dacian, a good friend from the tech scene, practically dragged me out of bed to create my CV (I was indeed indifferent, not just underestimating my skills). My first CV was created in NOTEPAD! I even went so far as to print it out in case sending it online wasn\u0026rsquo;t enough—at that time, I had no idea how job applications worked. It was the first time I had ever done something like that.\nThe Opportunity # So, after some persuasion, my friend had seen an advertisement a few days earlier for a System Administrator position at a company called Netex. His excitement was contagious because, let\u0026rsquo;s face it, most people in IT, at least in my town, associated the field strictly with programming. Knowing I was interested in sysadmin roles (having run an online gaming community with him back in 2012), he didn\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to support me and push me into the workforce 😄.\nThe Interview Process # When I arrived at the company\u0026rsquo;s headquarters, I felt a bit anxious, but the process was quick. I submitted my CV and was informed that someone from HR would contact me soon for an update. After leaving, I almost completely forgot about that moment, but within a week, I received a phone call to schedule an interview.\nThe Technical Interview # It had been nearly two weeks since I submitted my CV, and the day of the interview finally arrived. At the company\u0026rsquo;s main office, I was invited into a conference room with an HR representative and the head of the IT department. They started by introducing the company, what they did, and what they were looking for. Then, it was my turn to express what I sought from an employer and share my experience.\nI realized I had the logic but perhaps not the appropriate tech vocabulary. Nevertheless, this logic led to a pleasant and relaxed conversation. First IT job interview questions # Here are some of the questions and how I recall responding:\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re a beginner, try to answer these questions before checking the solutions! 😄\nQ: What is the administrator user in Linux? Show Answer A: root Q: How do you view the open ports locally on a Linux machine? Show Answer A: netstat -tulpen Q: How do you view open ports on a remote Linux machine? Show Answer A: nmap Q: What are the basic file permissions in Linux? Show Answer A: r - read(4), w - write(2), x - execute(1) Q: What are the ports for the following protocols?(https, ssh, imap, smtp, dns, etc.) Show Answer A: http - 80; https - 443; ssh - 22; I don\u0026rsquo;t know the others off the top of my head, but I can find out quickly using the command: cat /etc/services | grep -i mysql My experience has taught me that responses like this, which are somewhat out-of-the-box, are highly appreciated as they provide interviewers with a clear perspective about you, showing that you haven\u0026rsquo;t just memorized facts but truly understood the logic behind the topics.\nQ: What is /etc/shadow? Show Answer A: A file that contains local users and their encrypted passwords on Linux systems, visible only to the root user. The Offer # The next day, I decided to attend a class at the university since I was in Timișoara, where I was enrolled (I was commuting from my hometown). During that time, I didn\u0026rsquo;t attend classes frequently as I had become quite bored with the idea of university. I do not recommend anyone to skip out, as I believe it\u0026rsquo;s a significant advantage, just not for me.\nI had barely finished my first class when I got a call from the company where I interviewed, telling me I got the job! Upon arriving at the office, I met again with HR and the department head. I accepted the offer, which I believe was slightly above the minimum wage in Romania. I was not focused on the salary aspect, as I had never approached this field with that mindset; it seemed to come naturally.\nNext Steps # From this point, my technical journey at my first job can be found here: merox.dev/resume/. It was certainly a place where I learned a lot and even made friends; I still occasionally go out for a beer with my former department head. 😊\nThis concludes the first chapter of my Merox IT Journey series that I am starting on my blog. If you made it this far, I hope you found my experience at least somewhat interesting. I welcome your feedback and would love for you to share your own experiences as well!\nStay tuned for more stories from my IT journey in future blog posts!

I’ve always been a bit lazy when it comes to getting up to switch things off manually, but once I discovered the potential of smart devices like Amazon Alexa and Home Assistant, I was hooked. Over time, I’ve expanded the system to include a wide range of devices that automate my entire home.\nDevices I Use # In my smart home setup, I’ve integrated several key devices:\nAmazon Alexa: I use Alexa in every room (living room, bedroom, kitchen) to control most devices via voice commands. Home Assistant: Running on a Dell server through a VM, Home Assistant is the central brain of my setup, managing more complex automations and scripts. Broadlink RM4 Pro: This acts as a bridge for RF and IR devices, allowing me to control roller blinds and non-smart appliances. Philips Hue \u0026amp; Goove Lights: These add mood lighting, often synchronized with specific routines like \u0026ldquo;movie time\u0026rdquo;. Roborock Vacuum, Resideo Thermostat, and air conditioning units. Smart Roller Blinds: Controlled through Broadlink using RF signals. In the near future, I plan to add cameras and a Yale smart lock.\nAlexa and Home Assistant # Initially, Alexa controlled most of the devices, but once I introduced HA(Home Assistant), things got even more flexible. I now have full automation based on my location, weather conditions, and custom scripts. For example, when I leave the house, motion sensors activate, and all roller blinds close automatically. When I return, the system opens the blinds, adjusts the temperature based on the outside weather, and even turns on night lights to guide me through the dark.\nExample Automations # Morning and Night Routines # One of the key routines I rely on is Good Morning and Good Night, which create a seamless transition from sleep to waking and vice versa. These routines handle:\nOpening the blinds to a certain level in the morning to let in natural light. Shutting down all lights and closing the blinds in the evening to create the perfect environment for sleep. This automation has made mornings feel more natural and relaxing, and night routines are much more consistent without having to remember to switch everything off.\nMovie and Gaming Time # When it’s time for a movie or gaming session, I have created automations to handle the ambiance and setup:\nMovie Time: The blinds in the living room close, the TV turns on and switches to Netflix, the soundbar is set to a specific sound mode, and the air conditioning turns on if it’s summer. Additionally, the ambient lighting around the TV adjusts to create the perfect movie-watching environment. Gaming Time: Similar to Movie Time, but the TV connects to the PlayStation 5, and the lights adjust for a more immersive experience. Alexa - Routine1 Alexa - Routine2 Philips Hue Alexa, movie time\nSecurity Setup # For security, my motion sensors automatically trigger when I leave, and I receive notifications via Alexa and Home Assistant if anything unusual happens. For instance, any significant changes in room temperature or other unexpected events will prompt alerts, helping me stay in control even when I’m away.\nTutorial: Integrating Broadlink with Alexa \u0026amp; RF Learning # Here’s a simple tutorial on how I used Broadlink RM4 Pro to integrate RF devices like my roller blinds with Alexa.\nStep 1: Set Up Broadlink RM4 Pro # Download the Broadlink app and follow the steps to connect the RM4 Pro to your Wi-Fi. Register an account and add the RM4 Pro device in the app. Step 2: Learn RF Signals # Select Add Remote in the Broadlink app, and choose \u0026ldquo;RF Appliance\u0026rdquo;. Use your original remote for the roller blinds, press the corresponding button while the app is in Learning Mode, and save the learned code. Test the new button to make sure it controls the blinds. Step 3: Connect Broadlink to Alexa # In the Alexa app, enable the Broadlink skill. Link your Broadlink account and let Alexa discover your RF devices. Now, you can use voice commands like, “Alexa, close the blinds,” and it will work seamlessly.\nBroadlink - Dashboard Broadlink - IR/RF Broadlink - Learning Challenges and Advanced Automations # The Most Challenging Part: Running Linux Scripts # One of the more challenging aspects was getting Home Assistant to correctly execute Linux scripts based on my GPS location. Using bash commands, I created scripts that adjust server fan speeds based on external temperatures when I leave or return home.\nFor example:\nWhen I’m away, the server fan speeds up to keep the system cool. Lights automatically adjust, and blinds close. When I come back, the system reverses these actions. /root/homeassistant/configuration.yaml #!/bin/bash # Adjust server fan speed based on external temperature shell_command: set_fans_home: \u0026#39;ssh -i /config/ssh/id_rsa -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no root@10.10.10.10 /usr/bin/ipmitool -I lanplus -H 10.10.10.200 -U root -P SuperSecretPassword raw 0x30 0x30 0x02 0xff 0x14\u0026#39; set_fans_away: \u0026#39;ssh -i /config/ssh/id_rsa -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no root@10.10.10.10 /usr/bin/ipmitool -I lanplus -H 10.10.10.200 -U root -P SuperSecretPassword raw 0x30 0x30 0x02 0xff 0x28\u0026#39; Future Plans # In the near future, I plan to integrate more advanced routines based on my location and possibly automate the Yale smart lock to engage whenever I leave home. The ability to do this with a combination of Alexa and Home Assistant makes the whole process incredibly smooth.\nMore automations # Below, you can see more simple automations videos from my smart home Balcony lights Roborock start cleaning Hue motion sensor\nConclusion # Building a smart home is an ongoing project, and with tools like Broadlink, Alexa, and Home Assistant, it’s more accessible than ever. Whether you’re just starting or already have a setup, there’s always room for improvement and more efficient automation. The beauty of smart home devices lies in how they can adapt to your personal routines and preferences, making everyday life a little easier.\nCredits # 📹 Smart Home Solver - YouTube Channel. 📹 Grayson Adams - YouTube Channel. 📹 Smart Home Junkie - YouTube Channel. 📹 Everything Smart Home - YouTube Channel.

This time, I used a Dell PowerEdge R720 server, equipped with 192 GB of RAM, dual 6-core CPUs (24 threads), and no GPU, to familiarize myself with various AI tools. Having done some investigation into this matter, three major tools attracted my attention-Stable Diffusion, OpenWebUI and Ollama. Each tool has unique features while together they make up a functional AI environment for me to play around with.\nBelow are brief descriptions of the tools:\nStable Diffusion: A model that generates high-quality images from text prompts, ideal for exploring AI-generated art. OpenWebUI: An intuitive interface that makes it easier to manage and interact with AI models. Ollama: A versatile AI framework designed for seamless integration and reliable performance. In this article, I will go over how I set these tools up on my server as well as their configurations. The difficulties that were there , the solutions I found and useful tips that may be helpful when working under similar conditions will also be shared. Even though still new in Artificial Intelligence systems at least my experience can be of great help to others who may want to start too.\nSetting Up Ollama: My First Step into AI # The first tool I tackled was Ollama. After doing some research, it seemed like a good starting point because of its straightforward setup and broad compatibility. Ollama is a flexible AI framework that can be installed on all major platforms—Linux, MacOS, and Windows—which made it accessible no matter what system you’re running. Plus, it provides a solid foundation for further AI experiments, which is exactly what I needed for my home lab.\nInstalling Ollama on Linux # I began by setting up Ollama on a virtual machine running Ubuntu 22.04 in my Proxmox environment. I allocated 20 cores and 64GB of RAM to this VM to ensure smooth performance during testing.\nTo install Ollama, I used the following command:\ncurl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh Downloading the Llama3 Model # Once the installation was complete, the next step was to download a model to work with. I chose the Llama3 model, which is known for its performance in various AI tasks. To download it, I ran the command:\nollama pull llama3 Running the Llama3 Model # ollama run llama3 example \u0026ldquo;llama3 cli example\u0026rdquo; # How does the concept of time dilation in Interstellar relate to Einstein\u0026rsquo;s theory of relativity?\nThe concept of time dilation in Interstellar is directly related to Albert Einstein\u0026rsquo;s theory of special relativity, specifically the concept of time dilation. Here\u0026rsquo;s how:\nIn the movie, a wormhole allows Cooper\u0026rsquo;s spaceship to travel at incredibly high speeds, approaching relativistic velocities. As they approach the speed of light (0.99c), time appears to slow down for them relative to Earth. This is precisely what Einstein predicted in his theory\u0026hellip;\u0026quot;\nSetting Up Stable Diffusion # Stable Diffusion is a powerful model for generating high-quality images from text prompts. Setting it up on my Ubuntu 22.04 VM was quite straightforward thanks to the clear installation guide provided in the official GitHub repository.\nInstallation Steps # Here’s a summary of the steps I followed to install Stable Diffusion:\nInstall the Dependencies # Depending on your Linux distribution, use one of the following commands to install the necessary dependencies:\nDebian-based (e.g., Ubuntu):\nsudo apt install wget git python3 python3-venv libgl1 libglib2.0-0 Red Hat-based:\nsudo dnf install wget git python3 gperftools-libs libglvnd-glx openSUSE-based:\nsudo zypper install wget git python3 libtcmalloc4 libglvnd Download the Web UI Script # Navigate to the directory where you want to install Stable Diffusion and execute the following command:\nwget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/master/webui.sh Run the WebUI Script # ./webui.sh Configure the webui-user.sh File # Since my server does not have a GPU, I needed to adapt the webui-user.sh file to optimize performance for CPU usage. Specifically, I added the following line to configure the environment for CPU-only operation:\nexport COMMANDLINE_ARGS=\u0026#34;--lowvram --precision full --no-half --skip-torch-cuda-test\u0026#34; \u0026ndash;lowvram: Reduces memory usage to accommodate systems with limited GPU memory.\n\u0026ndash;precision full: Ensures full precision calculations, useful for CPU processing.\n\u0026ndash;no-half: Disables half-precision calculations to avoid potential issues on CPUs.\n\u0026ndash;skip-torch-cuda-test: Skips tests related to CUDA, which is irrelevant on systems without GPUs.\nStart the Web UI # By default, running the webui.sh command will start the server and bind it to localhost (127.0.0.1). To allow access from other interfaces (useful for integration with OpenWebUI), use the \u0026ndash;listen parameter:\n./webui.sh --listen This command makes the server accessible on all network interfaces at port 7860 (0.0.0.0:7860).\nStable Diffusion Webpage Setting Up OpenWebUI # With Ollama and Stable Diffusion installed and configured, the next step is to centralize these tools into a single, user-friendly interface. OpenWebUI provides a cohesive platform to interact with your AI models, similar to ChatGPT.\nInstallation Steps # Setting up OpenWebUI is probably the easiest and quickest part of this tutorial, thanks to its well-organized and straightforward documentation. You can deploy OpenWebUI using Docker, which simplifies the installation process.\nInstallation with Default Configuration # If Ollama is running on the same server as OpenWebUI, use the following Docker command:\ndocker run -d -p 3000:8080 --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main If Ollama is hosted on a different server, you need to specify the URL of the Ollama server:\ndocker run -d -p 3000:8080 -e OLLAMA_BASE_URL=https://example.com -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main For running OpenWebUI with Nvidia GPU support, use this command:\ndocker run -d -p 3000:8080 --gpus all --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:cuda Integrating Ollama and Stable Diffusion # Once OpenWebUI is up and running, the next step is to integrate it with Ollama and Stable Diffusion via API connections.\nConnecting Ollama # Open your browser and navigate to: # OpenWebUI Admin Settings # Click to collapse 1.1 http://ip_server_openwebui:3000/admin/settings/\n1.2 Go to Models -\u0026gt; Manage Ollama Models.\n1.3 Enter the URL of your Ollama server\nAdmin Settings If you\u0026rsquo;re running Ollama and OpenWebUI on the same server, this step might be auto-filled.\nConnecting Stable Diffusion # Click to collapse 1.1 Go to Images and find the AUTOMATIC1111 Base URL field.\n1.2 Enter the URL of your Stable Diffusion server:\n1.3 Press the refresh check button next to the URL to verify the connection with the Stable Diffusion server.

This powerhouse boasts impressive specifications:\nTechnical Specifications # Server Model: Dell PowerEdge R720 RAM: 192GB Processors: Dual 6-core CPUs with Hyper-Threading (24 threads) iDRAC Controller: iDRAC7 Enterprise Storage: 2 x 2TB SSD \u0026amp; 6 x 300GB SAS drives at 6Gb/s This article covers my journey of integrating this powerhouse into my home lab setup.\nDelivery and Initial Setup # The server arrived in good condition, but I encountered an issue where the front backplane wasn\u0026rsquo;t connected because the included mini SAS cable was too short. I had to search online to find a 59cm mini SAS cable long enough to connect the backplane to the motherboard.\nI was lucky and I found this cable pretty quick thanks to this company in Romania:\ni-Service - MiniSAS\nConfiguring the Cooling System with IPMI-tool # Managing server cooling effectively is crucial for optimal performance and longevity. Using IPMItool, I was able to configure the fans to balance between cooling efficiency and noise levels. Below are the steps and commands I used:\nInstall IPMItool: # sudo apt-get install ipmitool Enable/disable manual fan control # Enable # ipmitool -I lanplus -H ip_addr -U username -P password raw 0x30 0x30 0x01 0x00 Disable # ipmitool -I lanplus -H ip_addr -U username -P password raw 0x30 0x30 0x01 0x01 Set fan speed # ipmitool -I lanplus -H ip_addr -U username -P password raw 0x30 0x30 0x02 0xff 0x14 Consult the table to adapt the speed to your needs # Procent Hexadecimal RPM 10% 0xA ~3,300 RPM 16% 0x10 ~3,900 RPM 20% 0x14 ~4,000 RPM 25% 0x19 ~4,700 RPM 30% 0x1E ~5,400 RPM 40% 0x28 ~7,300 RPM 50% 0x32 ~8,000 RPM 60% 0x3C ~9,400 RPM 70% 0x46 ~10,800 RPM 80% 0x50 ~12,100 RPM 90% 0x5A ~13,300 RPM 100% 0x64 15,000 RPM Monitor fan status # ipmitool sensor | grep -i fan Fine-tuning the fan speeds can drastically reduce the noise levels in a homelab environment, which is often a crucial consideration compared to a data center where noise is less of an issue. Upgrading Firmware via UpdateYODell.net # Keeping firmware up-to-date is essential for security and performance. I upgraded my R720\u0026rsquo;s firmware using the resources available on UpdateYODell.net. Here’s a step-by-step guide:\nIdentify Your Server’s Generation: # Visit Wikipedia\u0026rsquo;s Dell PowerEdge page to find your server model and its generation.\nConfigure iDRAC for FTP Update: # Access the iDRAC web interface. Navigate to Maintenance \u0026gt; System Update. Select FTP as the update method and use next settings: Address - ftp.updateyodell.net User Name - dell Password - calvin Path - g11, g12(dell r720), g13, or g14 Click Check for Updates and proceed with the upgrade. Updating the firmware ensures that the server runs smoothly and is protected against known vulnerabilities. It can also bring new features and improvements to your system, which is particularly beneficial in a home lab setting where experimentation and learning are key. Migrating Proxmox Cluster # Migrating my Proxmox cluster to the new server was simplified by utilizing an NFS share on my Synology DS223 in the homelab. Here’s how I did it:\nMount NFS Share on New Proxmox Server: # mount -t nfs \u0026lt;synology_ip\u0026gt;:/path/to/nfs /mnt/pve/nfs Restore VMs from NFS: # pct restore \u0026lt;vmid\u0026gt; /mnt/pve/nfs/dump/dump.tar Benefits of Using NFS with Proxmox: Using an NFS share for backups and migrations offers several advantages:\nSimplicity: Easy to set up and manage. Efficiency: Fast transfer speeds, especially with a dedicated network. Flexibility: Can easily expand storage as needed. Storage Configuration # In the Dell R720, I configured the storage with two 2TB SSDs in RAID 1 for the operating system and primary applications, and six 300GB SAS drives in RAID 10 for data storage. This setup offers a great balance between performance, redundancy, and storage capacity.\nBenefits of This Storage Setup: # RAID 1 for SSDs: Provides redundancy, ensuring that the OS and critical applications are safe even if one SSD fails. RAID 10 for SAS Drives: Combines the speed benefits of RAID 0 with the redundancy of RAID 1, offering fast read/write speeds and protection against drive failures. Integrating with UPS Using PowerPanel # To protect the server from power outages, integrating it with a UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) was crucial. Instead of using NUT, I opted for PowerPanel:\nInstall PowerPanel: # Download and install the PowerPanel software from the CyberPower website.\nDownload # curl -o cyberpowerpowerpanel.deb https://www.cyberpower.com/tw/en/File/GetFileSampleByType?fileId=SU-18070001-06\u0026amp;fileType=Download%20Center\u0026amp;fileSubType=FileOriginal Install # dpkg -i cyberpowerpowerpanel.deb Configure PowerPanel: # I configured PowerPanel in my environment with the following command:\npwrstat -lowbatt -runtime 300 -capacity 35 -active on -cmd /etc/pwrstatd-lowbatt.sh -duration 1 -shutdown on Explanation of the Command: # -lowbatt: Triggers the action when the battery is low. -runtime 300: Triggers the action when the UPS runtime drops below 300 seconds. -capacity 35: Triggers the action when the battery capacity drops below 35%. -active on: Enables the action. -cmd /etc/pwrstatd-lowbatt.sh: Executes the specified script when the condition is met. -duration 1: Specifies the duration in minutes to wait before executing the shutdown. -shutdown on: Initiates a system shutdown when the condition is met. This configuration ensures that my server shuts down gracefully in the event of a power outage, protecting data integrity and preventing hardware damage.\nMonitoring and Management # For monitoring the server\u0026rsquo;s performance and health, I use a combination of Prometheus and Grafana. These tools provide detailed metrics and visualizations, allowing me to keep an eye on resource usage, temperatures, and potential issues.\nBackup Strategy # Having a robust backup strategy is crucial in any lab environment. I use Proxmox\u0026rsquo;s built-in backup tools to create regular snapshots of my VMs, which are then stored on the NFS share. This ensures that I can quickly recover from any data loss or corruption.\nConclusion # Setting up the Dell R720 in my home lab has been an exciting journey. From configuring cooling and upgrading firmware to migrating my Proxmox cluster and integrating with a UPS, every step has enhanced my lab\u0026rsquo;s performance and reliability. Additionally, the advanced network and storage configurations have made my setup more robust and efficient. I hope this guide helps you in your home lab endeavors.\nStay tuned for more updates and experiments in my home lab!

Open the Machines page of the admin console, and locate the devices that you configured as subnet routers. You can look for the Subnets badge in the machines list, or use the property:subnet filter to see all devices advertising subnet routes. For each device that you need to approve, click the ellipsis icon menu at the end of the table, and select Edit route settings. In the Edit route settings panel, approve the device.\nThe Tailscale side of the routing is complete.

This media server stack includes Jellyfin, Radarr, Sonarr, Jackett, and qBittorrent. Let\u0026rsquo;s briefly dive into what each component brings to our setup\nApplication Description Jellyfin An open-source media system that provides a way to manage and stream your media library across various devices. Radarr A movie collection manager for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It automates the process of searching for movies, downloading, and managing your movie library. Sonarr Similar to Radarr but for TV shows. It keeps track of your series, downloads new episodes, and manages your collection with ease. Jackett Acts as a proxy server, translating queries from other apps (like Sonarr or Radarr) into queries that can be understood by a wide array of torrent search engines. qBittorrent A powerful BitTorrent client that handles your downloads. Paired with Jackett, it streamlines finding and downloading media content. Gluetun A lightweight, open-source VPN client for Docker environments, supporting multiple VPN providers to secure and manage internet connections across containerized applications. It ensures privacy and seamless network security with easy configuration and integration. The configuration for these applications is hosted on Longhorn storage, ensuring resilience and ease of management, while the media (movies, shows, books, etc.) is stored on a Synology NAS DS223. The NAS location is utilized as a Persistent Volume (PV) through NFS 4.1 by Kubernetes.\nIn this tutorial, you\u0026rsquo;ll find the Kubernetes configuration for each necessary component to set up, install, and secure each service used by the media server.\nSynology NAS NFS Setup for Kubernetes # If you use Synology NAS, this is the rule I created for my NFS share which will be mounted on kubernetes side.

It sets various security headers, including XSS protection and options to prevent MIME sniffing, among others. Create default-headers-media.yaml\n1apiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1 2kind: Middleware 3metadata: 4 name: default-headers-media 5 namespace: media 6spec: 7 headers: 8 browserXssFilter: true 9 contentTypeNosniff: true 10 forceSTSHeader: true 11 stsIncludeSubdomains: true 12 stsPreload: true 13 stsSeconds: 15552000 14 customFrameOptionsValue: SAMEORIGIN 15 customRequestHeaders: 16 X-Forwarded-Proto: https Apply with: kubectl apply -f default-headers-media.yaml\nCreating Ingress Route for Each Application # To expose each application securely, we create IngressRoutes using Traefik:\nAn IngressRoute for the application (such as Radarr) is defined, which uses the traefik-external ingress class. It listens on the websecure entry point and routes traffic based on the host (movies.merox.cloud in this example, replace with your domain). The middleware default-headers-media is applied to enhance security. TLS configuration is included, referencing a secret that contains the SSL/TLS certificate. Create app-ingress-route.yaml\n1apiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1 2kind: IngressRoute 3metadata: 4 name: app #radarr for example 5 namespace: media 6 annotations: 7 kubernetes.io/ingress.class: traefik-external 8spec: 9 entryPoints: 10 - websecure 11 routes: 12 - match: Host(`movies.merox.cloud`) # change to your domain 13 kind: Rule 14 services: 15 - name: app #radarr for example 16 port: 80 17 - match: Host(`movies.merox.cloud`) # change to your domain 18 kind: Rule 19 services: 20 - name: app #radarr for example 21 port: 80 22 middlewares: 23 - name: default-headers-media 24 tls: 25 secretName: mycert-tls # change to your cert name Apply with: kubectl apply -f app-ingress-route.yaml\nDon\u0026rsquo;t forget: You must create the host declared in your IngressRoute in your DNS server(s). Q\u0026amp;A # Q: Why use a ClusterIP service? A: Because we will be using Traefik as an ingress controller to expose it to the local network/internet with SSL/TLS certificates. Q: Can I download all manifest files from anywhere? A: SURE!
